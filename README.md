# Milestone Project 3 - Data Centric 
Data Centric Development Project - Code Institute 

## What The Project Acheive's 
---
The site is a warehouse management system that would be purchased and implemented in a storage company to handle and control their stock intake, movement and archvie. It is built using skills i have learnt to build a Flask framework website / application, the project also uses a MongoDB backend to store the data. Users can create, view, update and archive / delete data from the application in various forms which would aid the companies production and stock security. 

### Demo 
---
The site can be accessed using the link here https://wms-project1.herokuapp.com/ 

### UX 
--- 
#### Wireframe 
The wireframes for the intial design of the site can be found in the static file in the github respository. The design and flow of the application evolved as the site came to life, from an on paper drawing through the balsamiq tool. 

#### User Stories 
<em>As the business owner i would want my stock to be stored securely and so it is easily accessable.</em>
- Stock to be stored on a database itemized by unique customer codes and descriptions. 

<em>As the admin assistant i want the stock easily accessable with all the tools on hand to control the flow of the stock.</em>
- Search function which filters out results and shows relevant information, also gathers all functionality in one place to allow ease of use. 

<em>As the admin assistant i want a area to store the active product information for our inventory.</em>
- Stock cards to be built in that show all basic product information. 

<em>As the warehouse manager i want the warehouse operatives to be able to recipt goods onto the system but the process to be simple so it can be achieved by anyone in a efficient time.</em>
- A simple warehouse operative view will show only the required fields needed to perform relevant tasks. 

<em>As the business owner i want certain fields i.e delete only accessbale to managers.</em>
- Certain fields and functions will be only visable to certain user types. 

#### UX design
The site was created simple in design this is down to the application targeted at the storage & distrbution industires, i felt the simple design would lend to it being accessable and useable to all employees throughout a business. Keeping the design simple would avoid intimidating less tech savvy employees, rather than an over complicated site which didn't fit the intended purpose. 

The initial landing page lends to the business supplying the application with brief introduction and a link (to a dummy site), the login and register is clearly visable to move further into the application. 

The colour scheme for the site was set to lift the information from the page and make it easily visable the button colours transition through the site with icons to give a visual stimulus to the intent of the button. 

The site was built using Materialize as i had used Bootstrap in previous projects and wanted to ustilise another framework. 

The flow of the site works well and allows users to flow freely through all aspects of the site and the buttons and searches work well and as intended. 

#### Side Note! 
<strong>On building i had a issue with the CSS not loading all the classes i had built into the style.css file, mainly font color. I tried all routes to fix this including !important but they did not seem to load. to complete the project i utilized the materialze built in color classes. As i realize this is not the optimum method to style it was in neccesity rather than lack of knowledge.</strong>
